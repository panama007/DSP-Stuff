# DSP-Stuff

DSP demo visualizations in Python. Demos of STFT, MRA decomposition, Wavelet analysis, Spectrograms, etc.
## Dependencies

This project depends on:
numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pywt, PIL, Tkinter, python(obvs..)

## Motivation

This project is to help explain and visualize concepts in digital signal processing.
## How to Run

You want to run the "AIO.py" file. It stands for All In One, and as the name implies, displays all the demos. 
All the other files are also executable by themselves (except FourierWindow.py), if you only want to look at 1 one the demos.

In all the demos you will find controls on the left panel, and sometimes sliders at the bottom. The labels/naming should
make their purpose somewhat clear.

## Suggestions?

If you have any suggestions, shoot me an email at panama007(at)caltech.edu.
## Thanks!

Thanks for looking!
