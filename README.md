# DSP-Stuff

DSP demo visualizations in Python. Demos of Fourier Series, Short-Time Fourier Transform, MRA decomposition, Wavelet analysis, Spectrograms, etc.
## Dependencies

This project depends on:
numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pywt, PIL, Tkinter, python(obvs..)

## Motivation

This project is to help explain and visualize powerful concepts in digital signal processing (DSP).
## How to Run

You want to run the "All In One.py" file. It displays all the demos. 
All the other files are also executable individually (except FourierWindow.py, which is the base class), if you only want to look at 1 one the demos.

In all the demos you will find controls on the left panel, and sometimes sliders at the bottom. The labels/naming should
make their purpose clear.

## Suggestions?
