STFT ------------------------------
Spectrogram, add ability to change to 3d display instead of 2d+color

Allow the window to scale when maximized

fix the "signal from file"

FFT of windowed signal too squeezed. Add "top peaks/freqs" or maybe change x-axis range
underneath Windows display the peaks


SCALOGRAM vs. SPECTROGRAM



MRA --------------------------------
Add "signal from file"

the time range seems fixed, although some of the signals are longer than others.


Data Generator FF Spectrogram ------
add ability to switch between FFT/spectrogram and wavelets/scalogram


DataGenerator ----------------------
add way more functions, look at the data files.
